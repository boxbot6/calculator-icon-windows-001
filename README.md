# Windows Icons

To install, download the zip file to a new folder or stable location & unzip it - Remember not to break this path by moving, renaming or deleting this folder in the future or all your changed icons may suddenly disappear if the system can't find them!
 
In Windows, right-click on the shortcut where you want to change the icon and select 'Properties', then make sure you are on the Shortcut tab (or Web Document tab if it's a webpage shortcut), then click the 'Change Icon' button. Browse to the directory where you placed the downloaded .ico files, select the one you want and then OK and then OK again...done.
