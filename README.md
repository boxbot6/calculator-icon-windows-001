To install make a new folder or choose a stable location to download, unzip and move the new icons to - Remember, if you break this path by moving, renaming or deleting this folder in the future all your changed icons may suddenly disappear!
 
In Windows, right-click on the shortcut you want to change the icon for and select “Properties”. In Properties, make sure you’re on the Shortcut tab (or Web Document tab if it's a webpage shortcut), then click the “Change Icon” button. Browse to the directory where you placed the downloaded .ico files, select the one you want and then select OK and then OK again...done.
